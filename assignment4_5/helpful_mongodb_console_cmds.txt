The database is structured to have the name "CS121PROJ" and a single collection called "tokens".


Before doing ANYTHING in the MongoDB console, do this:
    use CS121PROJ


Exit the console with:
	exit


Delete all data from the database:
    db.tokens.deleteMany({})


Query the database:
Find a single record:
    db.tokens.find( {"token_to_find" : {$exists : true} } )
Example:
    db.tokens.find({"about":{$exists:true}})
Would return all the docids and frequencies of the token "about".


Find out the size of the database:
    db.tokens.count()
